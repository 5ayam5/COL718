# Issue with Load Store
```
ld r1, 4[r3]
st r2, 10[r5]
```

1. Can't execute OOO
1. Both may resolve to same address
1. In case of exception, we need to make a clean cut
1. But if store has executed OOO, then memory state is corrupted
1. Loads cannot be directly sent to cache since there might be a pending store

## Resolution Ideas
1. Stores need to wait
1. Need to maintain their information somewhere
1. We use a store queue for this

# Load Store Queue
1. Allocate an entry at decode time
1. Deallocate later
1. Update entry when address is computed

## Computed Address of Store
Scan entries after this entry (if we encounter a load with same address, then forward) until

1. Store to same address
1. Store with unresolved address

## Computed Address of Load
Scan stores before this entry until

1. Found entry with same address - forward
1. Found entry with unresolved address - wait
1. Reached end of queue - request from memory

## Actual Implementation
Have two separate circular queues for load and store

### Load Queue Entry
1. Load address
1. Index of tail pointer in store queue when entry was added

### Store Queue Entry
1. Store address and value
1. Index of tail pointer in load queue when entry was added

### Basic Search
1. If there are $n$ entries, have a $n$ bit vector
1. $prec(i) =$ all locations before $i$ are set to $1$
1. $before(j) = \overline{prec(head)}\wedge prec(j)$ (if no wrap around)
1. $before(j) = \overline{prec(head)}\vee prec(j)$ (if wrap around)
1. $after(j) = \overline{prec(j)}\wedge \overline{map(j)}\wedge (prec(tail)\vee map(tail))$ (no wrap around)
1. $after(j) = (\overline{prec(j)}\vee prec(tail)\vee map(tail))\wedge \overline{map(j)}$ (no wrap around)
1. To search for resolved entries before $j$: $before(j)\wedge (match\vee\overline{resvd})$
1. Now to choose the leftmost or rightmost entry, we can use a similar to select logic

*We use a tree since it is completely parallelizable. Nix problems exist similar to P vs NP. (size n, poly(n) resources, time taken is poly(log(n)))*
