# Routing Table
1. Each node maintains a routing table and specifies the possible next hops based on final destination
1. Make a choice out of possibilities depending on congestion information
1. Take into account the delay incurred in sending flits the last time the channel was used

# Allocate Switch Ports
Can design a $m\times n$ switch for input vs output

## Combine Smaller Switches
1. For a $m\times n$ switch, latency is $m+n$ and area is $m\times n$
1. For $10\times 5$, we can combine as:
    i. $5$ switches of $2\times 1$ followed by $5\times 5$ switch - better
    i. $2$ switches of $5\times 2$ follows by $4\times 5$ switch

## Dimension Sliced Switch
Used for X-Y routing, saves on area

*Startup in switch industry will work really well. They are very expensive. SIT ke liye planning was done by faculties*

# Allocation and Arbitration
1. Arbiter chooses one out of $N$ requests for resource allocation
1. Allocator creates one to one mapping between $N$ requests and $M$ resources - bipartite matching

## Round Robin Arbiter
Combinational logic that performs round robin

## Matrix Arbiter
1. If given agent is not interested, it sets entries in its row to $0$ and in column to $1$
1. In every cycle, request is granted to the agent who has $1$ in all entries of its row
1. Once agent $i$ is done servicing, it sets all entries in its row to $0$ and all in column to $1$

## Separable Allocator
1. First column selects resource
1. Second column selects agent
1. Does not give maximal matching

## Wavefront Allocator
1. Start by giving each diagonal element a row and column token
1. Each round, row token moves 1 step to left, column moves 1 step down (with wraparound)
1. If agent $i$ is interested in resource $j$, it grabs both row and column token when it receives them
1. If some $i, j$ is chosen, then
    i. no other agent can request for resource $j$
    i. agent $i$ cannot request for any other resource
1. This ensures maximal matching

# Router Pipeline
1. Buffer Write
1. Route Computation
1. VC Allocation
1. Switch Allocation
1. Switch Allocation

# Lookahead Routing
1. Compute route for next hop
1. Send routing decision along with packet
1. Removes route computation from critical path
