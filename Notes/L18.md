title: Lecture 18 (Trace Cache)
--- 

i-cache is more important than d-cache since instruction fetch happens in order, hence it is more performance sensitive.

# Trace Cache
1. Basic blocks are defined - single point of entry and exit
1. Have a cache that can store such traces
1. If trace is accurate, prediction is not needed

## Approach
1. Trace consists of multiple cache lines
1. Linked list of cache lines
1. We store the decoded micro ops

## Design
1. Tag array
1. Data array
1. Controller
1. Fill buffer

### Tag Array
1. Tag
1. Valid
1. Type
1. Next way
1. Prev way
1. NLIP - address of next CISC instruction
1. micro IP - index into the table of micro ops

## Storage
1. Store trace segments in consecutive sets
1. The way number is stored in next set
1. Set # is used to determine the max size of linked list

## Rules
1. Never distribute micro ops across cache lines
1. Terminate a data line if more branch micro ops than a threshold
1. Terminate trace if we encounter indirect branch
1. Interrupt or branch misprediction notification
1. Maximum length reached
