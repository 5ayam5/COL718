# Bypassing
1. If router queues are empty
1. Attempt to directly traverse the switch

# Speculative VC Allocation
1. Allocate switch and VC simultaneously
1. Saves another stage if VC is found
1. Else, resort to conventional methods

# Late VC Selection
1. Maintain a queue of free VSc with each outgoing link
1. When head flit traverses the switch, assign it a VC from the queue
1. If free VC is not available, cancel the process and restart the conventional process

# Non-Uniform Cache (NUCA)
It is better to access data from adjacent cache lines since data traversal time is lesser

## Static NUCA
1. Map cache blocks to cache banks
1. Have mapping as tag ID | bank ID | set ID | byte

## Dynamic NUCA
1. Define a bank set - columns of banks
1. Home bank is the closest bank in the set from the core
1. For searching, we follow one of the three strategies
    i. Sequential
    i. Two-way
    i. Broadcast
1. On a hit, we move the block closer to the home bank
1. For eviction, instead of moving it to lower level, we move it away from home bank

# Performance Aspects
1. Architectural Simulator
1. Synthetic Traffic Based Simulator

## Synthetic Traffic Generation
1. Random traffic
1. Bit-complement - $(D_x, D_y) = (\bar{S_x}, \bar{S_y})$
1. Transpose - $(D_x, D_y) = (S_y, S_x)$
1. Bit-reverse
1. Bit-rotation - left or right shift
1. Shuffle - similar to left shift
1. Tornado - translation of coordinates along some line
