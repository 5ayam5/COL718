# Turn Graph
1. Both CDGs and RDGs lose orientation information of the channels
1. Consider any path C in the channel graph
1. The TG contains all the nodes and channels belonging to C
1. This preserves the orientation of the channels
1. TG does not contain any other channels
1. We insert new nodes called channel node in middle of each edge/channel
1. Cycle in channel nodes of TG $\iff$ cycle in CDG

## Properties
1. Every edge in the CDG translates to either a set of collinear nodes or turns in the TG
1. Every cycle in CDG is a cycle in TG
1. Every cycle in the CDG can be translated to a sequence of straight paths and turns in the corresponding TG

### Aim
From above we get that ensuring that there are no cycles in routing algorithm ensures that there will be no deadlock


# Cycle-Free Routing Algorithms

## Dimension-Ordered Routing
1. First move along one axis, then the other and so on
1. However, no path diversity
1. Cannot handle congestion

## Oblivious Routing (Valiant's Algorithm)
1. Select a random point P
1. Perform Dimension-Ordered routing from A to P and then from P to B
1. Low congestion because of high path diversity
1. However, the routes can be very long

## Minimally Oblivious Routing
1. Restrict the domain of P around B
1. Reduces path diversity

## Adaptive Routing
1. Out of all possible turns, use maximal subset of turns such that they can never form a cycle
1. For each cycle, remove one turn

### Examples
1. West-first
1. North-last
1. Negative-first

## Data Line based Routing
1. Explained for 2 VCs
1. Assume that each VC has its own deadlock free channel
1. Inject packet into VC0
1. If it crosses the "date line", it moves to VC1

# Causes for Deadlock
1. MutEx
1. Circular wait
1. No preemption
1. Hold and wait
