*apparently working memory is important*

# Shared Memory vs Message Passing

## Shared Memory
1. Easy to program
1. Issues with scalability
1. Code is portable across machines

## Message Passing
1. Hard to program
1. Scalable
1. Code may not be portable

# Amdahl's Law
$$T_{par} = T_{seq}\times\left(f_{seq} + \frac{1 - f_{par}}{P}\right)$$
$$S = \frac{1}{f_{seq} + \frac{1 - f_{par}}{P}}$$

# Gustafson-Barsis's Law
New workload: $W_{new} = f_{seq}W + (1 - f_{par})PW$

Sequential time: $T_{seq} = \alpha W_{new}$

Parallel time: $T_{par} = \alpha(f_{seq}W + (1 - f_{par})PW/P)$

Speed-up: $S = f_{seq} + (1 - f_{seq})P$

# Design Space of Multiprocessors
1. SISD - Single Instruction Single Data
1. SIMD - Single Instruction Multiple Data
1. MISD - Multiple Instruction Single Data
1. MIMD - Multiple Instruction Multiple Data
    i. SPMD - Single Processor Multiple Data
    i. MPMD - Multiple Processor Multiple Data

# Hardware Threads
1. Cores with large issue widths have wasted issue slots
1. Run multiple processes simultaneously on the same core
1. Maintain a hardware thread ID
1. Need separate ROBs (and some other hardware implementation details)

# Coarse-Grained Multithreading
1. Run instruction for each thread for $k$ cycles
1. Separate program counters, ROBs and retirement register files per thread
1. Thread ID is tagged with each entry
1. Switch in case of high-latency event

# Fine-Grained Multithreading
1. Small $k$
1. Switch happens in case of low-latency event as well

# Simultaneous Multithreading
1. Dynamically split the issue slots between threads
1. Heuristics
    - fairness
    - instruction criticality
    - thread criticality
    - instruction type
1. Hyperthreading is SMT but static partitioning

# Issues with Large Caches
1. Access times can be very slow
1. Parallel accesses will make it slower
1. Have distributed caches - "shared private cache"
