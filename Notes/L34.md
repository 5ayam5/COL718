# Confusion
1. If a single bit in the key is changed, then most or all of the ciphertext bits should be affected
1. This ensures that the key and ct are not related

# Diffusion
1. If we change a single bit in the plaintext, then half the bits in ct should change
1. Prevents related message attacks

# Rounds in AES
1. Write the $16$ bytes as a $4\times 4$ matrix
1. Replace each of them using a lookup table S-box
1. Left rotate the $i^{th}$ row by $i$ positions
1. Take the four bytes in each column and modular multiply it with a matrix
1. Compute a bitwise XOR with the round key

# Generating Round Key
1. Rotate word
1. Substitute word
1. XORWord - $B_0B_1B_2B_3\to$
    - $B_0 = RC[i]$
    - $RC[0] = 1$, $RC[i] = 2\cdot RC[i-1]$

# AES Algo
1. First round - only the XOR with round key is performed
1. Final round - mix columns is skipped
