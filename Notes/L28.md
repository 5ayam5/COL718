# PLSC and Coherence
1. If accesses to a single location preserve program order, then we have no issues
1. However, we might have non-atomic writes because of other addresses
1. Accesses for a single address are atomic

# Ordering between Accesses to same Variable
(observer is at the core)

1. Read $\to$ Read: no difference
1. Write $\to$ Read: this may be global since writes might reach later for other cores (since atomicity need not exist)
1. Write $\to$ Write: needs to be global
1. Read $\to$ Write: this becomes global since writes are ordered

# Axioms of Coherence
1. Write Serialization: Writes to the same location are globally ordered
1. Write Propagation: A write is eventually seen by all the threads

# `fence`
1. Store instruction completes when all threads can read the new value
1. Instruction that ensures that all instructions prior to it complete execution
1. It is a memory barrier

# Execution Witness
1. Parallel Execution $\to$ Execution Witness $\to$ Sequential Execution
1. If we can create SE that obeys the memory model, then the execution is valid
1. EW is a graph with nodes as instructions
1. Edges can be local and global
1. These edges are happens-before edges (hb)
