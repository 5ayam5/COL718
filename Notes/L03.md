# Performance Considerations
1. Performance cannot be gauged with clock speed or RAM
1. Fasteness is comparable only when given a program

## Performance Equation
$$\frac{programs}{time} = \frac{programs}{instructions}\cdot\frac{instructions}{cycles}\cdot\frac{cycles}{time} = \frac{IPC\times frequency}{instruction}$$
(assumes just 1 program)

### Instructions
Depends on compiler

### Frequency
1. Depends on transistor technology
1. If there are more (or smaller) pipeline stages, then frequency is higher
1. $\frac{1}{frequency} = time_{cycle} = \frac{T}{k} + L$ ($k$ pipelines, $L$ = latch delay)
1. Adding too many stages will increase forwarding logic, thus being counter productive after a point
1. $P \propto f^3 \implies \Delta T \propto P$ - thus pipeline stages which had gone to 27 came down to somewhere between 12-15

### IPC
1. Depends on architecture and compiler
1. Will be primary focus of the book (course as well?)
1. Ideal IPC of in-order pipeline is $1$, typically $< 1$

#### CPI
$$CPI = CPI_{ideal} + \text{stall\_rate} \times \text{stall\_penalty}$$

1. Stall rate will remain constant with pipeline stages (empirical)
1. Stall penalty increases with more pipeline stages

#### Increasing IPC
1. Issue more than one instructions per cycle
1. Make it a superscalar processor (it is hard to do this)
    i. very complex stall and forwarding paths
    i. of the order of $O(n^2)$ for $n$-issue processor
    i. if there are branches, then our party is over

# Out of Order Pipelining
1. Much better solution
1. Consumer is executed after producer

## Basic Principle
1. Create a pool if instructions
1. Find instructions that are mutually independent and have all their operands ready
1. Execute them OOO

**ILP**: Instruction Level Parallelism - number of ready and independent instructions we can simultaneously execute

## Understanding OOO
1. Construct a dependency graph
1. Make directed edges from consumer to producer
1. Execute all nodes with no outgoing edges
1. Larger graph is always better so that all processor units are active

## Issues
1. Need to figure out instruction window size
    - typical window size is 64 to 128
1. How do we handle branching and ensure that each instruction is on the correct branch
    - need a very accurate branch predictor
    - typically 1 in 5 instructions is a branch
    - need to predict the following:
        i. if it is a branch
        i. if it is taken or not
        i. where is the target of the branch

## Math of Branch Prediction
Number of instructions: $n$
Number of branches: $n/5$
Probability of incorrect prediction: $p$
Probability of at least one mistake: $P_n = 1 - (1 - p)^{n/5}$

For $n = 100$, if $P_n$ has to be at most $10%$, $p$ has to be $< 0.5%$

Highest accuracy in A1 is observed to be $97%$, very poor :(
