*knowing English and following Indian accent are two different things*

# Directory Protocol
1. When we do not have a bus
1. Have a dedicated structure called directory
1. It co-ordinates the actions of coherence protocol
1. Sends and receives messages to/from caches and lower levels

## Directory Entry
1. State
1. Block address
1. List of shareres

## Design of Directory
1. RdX - locate a sharer and fetch the block
1. WrX and WrX.u - ask all sharers to invalidate their lines and give exclusive rights to write requestor
1. Evict - delete the sharere from entry

## Issues
1. Need a very large directory
1. Directory may also become a point of contention

## Resolution Ideas
1. Distributed directories - split the physical address space, resolves contention issues
1. Directory as cache - if entry is evicted from directory, invalidate all sharers

## How to Maintain List of Shareres
1. Fully mapped scheme - inefficient
1. Maintain a bit for a set of caches - snoopy protocol inside this set
1. Partially mapped scheme - store id of only $k$ sharers, if more than $k$, broadcast

# Memory Models

## Write-to-Read Order
1. `rfi` is not global
1. Because of LSQ forwarding and write buffers

## Non-Atomic Writes
1. `rfe` is not global
1. Because of local tiles of caches

## Write-to-Write Order
1. This is not allowed even if writes are atomic
1. But is violated in case of non-blocking caches

## Read-to-Read Order
1. Violated because of OOO loads in LSQ

## Read-to-Write Order
1. Is maintained in OOO machines in general
1. Violated when we have speculative writes

## Can `rfi` be relaxed in SC?
1. Answer is yes
1. Proof is in book
