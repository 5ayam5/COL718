# Program Order (po) Edge
1. Edges between reads and writes (both directions)
1. Edges between instruction and synch (both directions)

# Read From (rf) Edge
1. Write to read edge
1. Can be external and internal
1. If writes are atomic, then `rfe` edges are global
1. `rfi` is not global because of LSQ forwarding

# Write Serialization (ws) Edge
1. Originates from PLSC and coherence
1. Is always global

*small is beautiful - not sir talking about class size*

# From Read (fr) Edge
1. Read to write edge
1. It is global

# Synchronization Edge (so) Edge
1. Exist for synchronization variables
1. All updates to such variables are synch

# Summary
1. `ws`, `fr` and `so` are always global
1. `ppo` $\subset$ `po` be global
1. `grf` $\subset$ `rf` be global
1. `grf` $=$ `rf` and `ppo` $=$ `po` will hold in case of SC
1. `ghb` $=$ `ppo` $\cup$ `ws` $\cup$ `fr` $\cup$ `grf`
1. Subset is decided according to memory model

# Cycles in EW
1. We perform a toposort to get the sequential execution
1. If sort is not possible, then we have a cycle

# Access Graph
1. `up` edges between accesses to same location in same thread
1. `PLSC` $\equiv$ `up` $\cup$ `ws` $\cup$ `fr` $\cup$ `grf`

# Data and Control Dependence
1. We add causal dependencies (`dep` edges) for if (and similar) statements
1. Otherwise we might have "thin air read"
1. `causal graph $\equiv$ `rf` $\cup$ `gpo` $\cup$ `dep`
