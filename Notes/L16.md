# SRAM Array

## SRAM Cell
1. Cross-coupled inverter pair
1. Can be implemented in CMOS as well

## Array
1. Have row address and column address
1. Column is chosen using a mux
1. Row address is used to enable the word line for the entire row

### Two Lines
1. We have two outputs BL and BL' for each cell
1. Instead of waiting for the capacitor to charge up, we measure the difference
1. *similar to tarazu - we are that old!*
1. Also helps eliminate noise

### Precharging Trick
We precharge both lines to 0.5V

# CAM Array

## CAM Cell
1. SRAM Cell on top
1. Surrounded by A' and A lines
1. Match line is below SRAM cell
1. T1, T2 in series on left; T3, T4 in series on right
1. When $Q = A$, match line has $> 0$ voltage

## Array
1. All WLs are set to 1
1. $A_i$'s are set to the tag address
1. Match is set to a non-zero value for all match lines
1. In case of match, a priority encoder will have the correct index

# CACTI
1. Finds optimal number of banks to have minimal access time, area, power
1. Cuts array into sub-arrays (= bank)

## P-Complete
Given $O(n)$ processors, solve problem in $O(poly(log(n))$

1. DFS
1. Given a circuit, give its output
1. Linear programming
