# When to use Locks
When multiple threads access same memory location and perform conflicting and concurrent accesses.

# Data Race
Pair of conflicting and concurrent accesses to the same regular variable constitute a data race.

- SC does not imply data race freedom
- Data race freedom implies SC

## Theorem
If we have a data race in a program (any memory model, any EW), we can construct an SC execution that also has a data race. Contrapositive is more important: if we cannot construct an SC EW that has a data race, then the program is data race free.
