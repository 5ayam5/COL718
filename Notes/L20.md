# Layout of Memory Chip
1. Checkerboard - core and cache bank alternate
1. Rim layout - cache inside, core outside

# Router
1. Each node has a router that communicates on its behalf
1. Has a data buffer to send information

## Connection between Routers
1. $D = kl^2$, $l$ is length of wire
1. Delay increases a lot as length increases

### Buffered Wires
1. Add buffers to reduce delay
1. For optimal number of buffers, we get minimum delay as $D = 2\sqrt{kd}l - d$, where $d$ is delay of buffer

# Multi Layer Interconnects
Alternates between horizontal and vertical between different vertical layers

# Interconnect in Silicon Chips
1. Bus approach - fails trivially
1. Tiling - Network on Chip

## NoC
1. Arrange a set of nodes as tile
1. Router sends and receives all messages for its tile
1. Router also performs forwarding

# Parameters

## Bisection Bandwidth
1. Number of links that need to be snapped to divide NoC into two equal parts
1. Gives idea of *path diversity*

## Diameter
Maximum optimal distance between any two pair of nodes

*Note: Sir knows Delhi roads quite well*

# Topologies
1. Chain
1. Ring
1. Fat tree
1. Mesh
1. Torus
1. Folded torus
1. Hypercube
1. Clos Network

## Hybercube
1. Recursive structure
1. If it has $N$ nodes,
    - diameter = $\sqrt{N}$
    - bisection bandwidth = $N/2$

## Clos Network
1. $nr$ inputs and outputs
1. Inner layer has a $(m\times m)r$ switches
1. Performs a permutation
1. If $m \geq n$, we can reconnect unused input to unused output by rearranging
1. If $m \geq 2n - 1$, we can reconnect without rearrangement

### Butterfly Network
Uses only $2\times 2$ switches and $\log(n)$ layers

# Message Transmission - Hierarchy of Messages Sent
1. Message
1. Packet - head flit, body flits, tail flit
1. Flit - flow control digit (typically 8 or 16 bytes)
1. Phit - physical digit

# Flow Control
1. We can't drop flits unlike in network transmission
1. Sender needs to have idea about free space at receiver's end

## Credit Based Flow Control
1. Sender (A) maintains an estimate of number of free buffers at receiver (B)
1. If A thinks B has enough free space, only then it sends

### Assumptions
1. Routers are clock synchronized
1. Time is measured in number of cycles
1. We first receive a message, process it and add it to buffer
1. Status messages are 1 phit each

### Formulation
$$t_D = t_{ph} + t_f + 2t_{pr}$$
$$t_{ph} =\text{ time taken for receiving status message (credit) - phit}$$
$$t_f =\text{ time to send flit}$$
$$t_{pr} =\text{ processing time}$$
