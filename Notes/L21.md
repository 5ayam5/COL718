# Credit Based Flow Control (contd)
1. If $t_D / t_f$ buffers are available, then A will never stall
1. But need to send 2x messages

# On-Off Flow Control
Only send credit when number of free buffers falls below $N_{off}$ or rises above $N_{on}$

## Analysis
1. $N_{off} \geq t_D / t_f$ (can be determined using risky period - both flits and credit in transit)
1. $N - N_{on}$ should be greater than a threshold for efficiency: $N \geq 2t_D / t_f$

# Circuit Switching
1. Reserve path from source to destination
1. On reservation, send message
1. After sending message, clear buffer

## Space Time Diagram
1. Probing time: $K$ cycles
1. Response time: $K$ cycles
1. Sending time: $K + L/B - 1$
1. Total time = $3K + L/B - 1$

## Pros and Cons
1. Good for bulk transfer
1. Terrible for single transfer
1. Locks up resources

# Packet based Flow Control - Store and Forward
1. Receive entire packet at next router, then forward
1. Takes $K * L/B$ cycles

# Virtual Cut Through (VCT)
1. Don't wait for entire packet to come
1. Takes $K + L/B - 1$ cycles
1. But need to ensure enough space for entire packet

## Solution
1. Flow control at flit level
1. But more issues
