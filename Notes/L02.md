# 5 Stage Pipeline (recap)
1. Instruction fetch - IF
1. Instruction decode (+ operand fetch) - OF
1. Execute stage - EX
1. Memory access - MA
1. Register write-back - RW

This is part of GATE syllabus and we are *GATEd*

There are back connections from:

1. EX to IF - for branching
1. RW to OF - for write back

# In-Order Pipelining
1. Multiple instructions were at different places in the pipeline
1. This leads to issues:
    i. Structural hazards
    i. Instruction dependency
        - insert nop aka bubbles
        - forward the value using multiplexers
        - forwarding paths:
            1. RW $\to$ MA
            1. RW $\to$ EX
            1. RW $\to$ OF
            1. MA $\to$ EX
        - EPIC project tried to move this to compiler stage but didn't go anywhere
        - Load use hazard leads to impossibility when EX needs MA load
    i. Control hazard when branching
        - predict
        - execute branch independent instructions (compiler level optimisation) - delayed branch
        - need to balance between compiler and hardware optimisations
